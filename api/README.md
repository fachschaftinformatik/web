# api

The OpenAPI spec at `openapi.yaml` uses OpenAPI 3.1.
Because `oapi-codegen` doesnâ€™t fully support 3.1 yet (see the [open issue][4]), we apply an Overlay
during generation to temporarily downshift to OpenAPI 3.0 for codegen while keeping 3.1 as the source of truth.

To generate the Go server, run:
```sh
go generate
```
The generated files are written to `internal/api`.

To review changes:
```sh
git diff internal/api
```
